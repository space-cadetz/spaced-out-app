> Without an explicit redirect, the Netlify bots assume you‚Äôre requesting a page separate
> from /index.html and since that page doesn't actually exist, it returns an error.

To enable clean URLs in your Netlify deployed SPAs, add the following rule to your `_redirects` file:

````bash
/* /index.html 200
````
